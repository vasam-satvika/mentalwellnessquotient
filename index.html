        <p class="sectionTag text-big">WHAT'S MQ? </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Mental health wellness is a key component in establishing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
             Mental health wellness is just as important as physical and medical health, so it is important to learn 
             strategies to maintain good mental health.

            The definition of mental wellness is the awareness of one’s own ability to cope with stressors of day-to-day life while maintaining the ability to function effectively when socializing, working, learning and taking care of personal health and hygiene. A person that fits the 
            definition of mental wellness has a positive sense of wellbeing and hope, despite daily stressors and challenges. Overall, mental health wellness depends on factors, 
            like self-acceptance, autonomy, quality of relationships, capacity for personal growth, and overall life satisfaction.

         <p class="sectionTag text-big">Why Mental wellness is important? </p>
         <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We live in a country where depression is one of the most underrated and overlooked illness that is often ignored because of the fear of being misunderstood by most of the people. We can’t quash the fact that we all encounter some sort of mental disturbances at some point of time in life when we feel bewildered, confused, deep sorrow and lost. The intensity of these situations is such that we hardly can nullify the importance of mental wellness among children, young groups and adults. Yes, there is no age to be a victim of depression and heart quenching void. There are various ways
          to improve your mental wellness depending on the severity, counselling or psychological consultation being one of them.
